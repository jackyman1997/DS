The 3 financial statements you need to know:

• Balance Sheet - Are you Stable
• Income Statement - Are you Profitable
• Statement of Cash Flows - Will you Survive


• Balance Sheet

A balance sheet is a snapshot of your business at a specific point in time, and
The balance sheet tells you whether your business is healthy:

• Is there cash?
• Can you pay your bills?
• How much debt do you have?
• What is the book value of the business?

The structure of a balance sheet is:

Assets = Liabilities + Equity

This formula is intuitive when you remember.


A company has to pay for what it owns (assets) by either:

• borrowing money (liabilities), or
• bringing on investors (equity)


• Assets are what you own

Listed top to bottom in order of liquidity, which is how quickly they can be converted to cash:

• cash
• inventory (goods available for sale)
• accounts receivable (what people owe you)
• Fixed assets (land, machinery, equipment, and buildings)

Increase your assets over time.


• Liabilities are what you owe

Current liabilities are due within 1 year:

• accounts payable
• income tax payable
• current portion of debt

Long-term liabilities are due at any point after that:

• long-term debt
• mortgages payable

Liabilities provide you working capital.


• Equity is what you're worth

If you sold your assets and paid your liabilities, equity is what is left over:

• money contributed (common shares)
• profits taken out of the business (dividends)
• earnings retained in the business (retained earnings)


• Balance sheet focus:

• how much cash is there 
• can current assets cover liabilities
• can the company meet its debt obligations
• what is the debt to equity ratio (lower is healthier)


• Balance sheet analysis

Now that we know how the financial statement is structured, 

we can talk about how to analyze it.

There are three types of ratios we will review on the balance sheet:

• liquidity
• solvency
• profitability


• liquidity ratios

Liquidity ratios show your ability to turn assets into cash and include:

• cash ratio
• quick ratio
• current ratio


• solvency ratios

Solvency ratios show your ability to pay off debts and include:

• cash ratio
• quick ratio
• current ratio
• debt to equity
• interest coverage
• essential solvency ratio


• profitability ratios

Profitability ratios show your ability to generate income from your balance sheet assets and include:

• return on assets
• return on equity
• return on invested capital
• return on capital employed


• Cash ratio

$$ 
\text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash} + \text{Cash Equivalent}}{\text{Total Current Liabiities}}
$$

The cash ratio measures your total cash and cash equivalents against your total liabilities.

It is an indicator of your value under a worst case scenario, such as a bankruptcy or business shutdown.

A larger ratio is better.


• Quick ratio

$$ 
\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabiities}}
$$

The quick ratio measures your ability to meet your short-term obligations with your most liquid assets - also called the acid test ratio.

A higher ratio = better liquidity and financial health.


• Current ratio

$$ 
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabiities}}
$$

The current ratio measures your ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year, sometimes called the working capital ratio.

A ratio less than one indicates any debts due within one year are greater than your current assets.


• debt to equity (Debt Equity Ratio)

$$ 
\text{Debt Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{Equity}}
$$

The debt to equity ratio compares total liabilities against total equity, and

it is used to evaluate how much leverage you are using in your business.

Less than 1 = safe
Greater than 2 = risky

Debt to equity is heavily dependent on industry.


• Future ratios

The following ratios will be reviewed when we look at the income statement:


Solvency:

• interest coverage
• essential solvency ratio


Profitability:

• return on assets
• return on equity
• return on invested capital
• return on capital employed



• Income Statement

The income statement shows:

• If you're efficient
• If you're profitable
• How to make better decisions
• How much money you're making
• What costs you will need to control


• Income Statement Structure

The structure of the income statement is revenue minus expenses. 

Revenue is what you earn from sales services:

• Merchandise 
• Revenue from services
• Miscellaneous revenue, such as interest


• Expenses

Expenses are broken into:

Cost of goods sold - what it costs you to manufacture what you sell.

Overhead expenses are costs required to run the business that aren't directly tied to revenue.


• Overhead expenses

There are two categories of overhead expenses:

• Variable Costs

Variable costs move up or down based on a level of activity:

If every unit we sell requires a $1 box. If we sell 100 units, it costs $100 and if we sell 5 units, $5.


• Fixed Costs

Fixed costs don't change with levels of activity.

You pay $10,000 per year in rent whether you sell 100 units or you sell 5 units.

Minimize fixed costs and control your variable costs.



• Statement of Cashflows

How much cash did you receive or use over a period of time from:

• financing
• operations
• investments 

opening cash + net increase or decrease of cash during the period = ending cash


• Cash flow from operating activities

How much cash is generated from business activities:

• rent
• cash from sales
• income tax payments
• salary and wage expense
• Cash flow from investing activities


Includes a company's investments:

• purchase and sale of assets
• loans made to vendors or received from customers
• purchase or sale of machinery, plant, and equipment


• Cash flow from financing activities

You raise capital from investors, banks, and shareholders:

• capital raised
• dividends paid
• principal on debt
• principal repayments


• Cash flow focus:

• Is cashflow positive
• Why is cashflow positive or negative
• Are operations strong enough without financing or investments

Can your company survive from operations or is it alive because of investments and financing.


TL;DR:

Financial statements don't need to be scary. 

There are three financial statements you need to know:

• Balance sheet
• Income statement
• Statement of cash flows

They tell you:

• Am I stable
• Am I profitable
• Am I going to survive
